#Person Class & Object

Work with your group to complete a Person class that contains:
the instance variables name, age and isAdult. 
create a constructor that accepts all three pieces of information
setters (mutators) for each instance variables
getters (accessors) for each instance variables
toString method that creates the second part of the display below (we will do together)

Create a main method that tests all the methods in the Person class
